# Food Tracker

The Food Tracker app helps you to track your daily consumed foods. 

You can add your daily consumed foods to the website easily. Hence, you can track your daily consumed protein, carbohydrate, fat, and calories.

*Motivation*: I'm currently learning Flask and following a Coursera course (course_link_here). This project idea was homework of this course, I wanted to add something from myself to increase functionalities and have some fun.

*Used Technologies*: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, Docker, Stripe, Plotly and some JS.

## Shop

I used Stripe integration to take payments. It was my first time using this API and it was fun. I'm using the test API of the Stripe so I added some foods and prices to my Stripe session.

Here how it looks when you clicked the "Shop" tab:

![shop](https://github.com/atasayginodabasi/food-tracker/assets/89684816/ebf7b3a7-589a-4d86-a24c-82d8698aef23)

You can reach all of the Stripe products that I added in a 3 columned manner. It shows the image of the product, name, and finally price. You can add products to your cart using the "-" and "+" buttons.

Your basket will be stored in the session data. So, if you do not reset your local storage the basket will be the same.

I added 2 MantÄ±, 1 Sushi, and 3 Noodles to my basket using this feature. You can reach your number of basket items just by looking the green basket icon:

![shop-1](https://github.com/atasayginodabasi/food-tracker/assets/89684816/e2d8ee2e-21bc-4df0-9aa8-bd881e97e40b)

Totally I have 6 items in my basket.

## Checkout

You can reach the Checkout Page just clicking the green basket icon on the top right-hand-side of the navbar. The checkout page is Stripe's website and users would make transactions here. You can see your added cart products and their prices here.

![checkout](https://github.com/atasayginodabasi/food-tracker/assets/89684816/49832609-d6b2-422f-ba05-d3d434cb852e)

If the transaction is completed successfully, you will be redirected to a small "Thank you" page.

### Future Work
- Creating a basket page to the user would delete or add more products to the cart
- Adding more analytics to the "My Summary" page
- Google Analytics integration for learning
